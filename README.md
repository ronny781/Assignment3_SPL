Implementation of simple social network server and client. The communication between the server and the client(s) will be
performed using a binary communication protocol. A connected user will be able to perform several commands. Register, login, follow other users, post messages, send DM's, block users, and get notifications.
The implementation of the server was based on the Thread-Per-Client (TPC) and Reactor servers. (We can choose which variation we want to run).
